# Experiment-6
Aim
The aim of this C++ code is to demonstrate the use of various looping constructs and nested loops.

Theory
We would be discussing about various Looping Constructs

1)do-while Loop

2)for Loop

3)while Loop

4)Nested for Loops

5)Nested do-while Loops

6)Nested while Loops

7)Nested for Loops (Matrix)

8)Nested for + while Loops (Matrix with Condition)
